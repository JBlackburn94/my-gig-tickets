# Business <a name="business"></a>

The business goal of this page is to allow users to upload the names of their favourite artists, which are then stored in a database. After this the user can then submit information about events they've seen and link the events to specific artists.

## External Users Goals

The external users goals of this page are to provide a database for users to store information on events they've been to in the past. In the future I'd like to add a feature where you can upload images and videos to the events. I would also like to develop an account system where each list of artists and events would be stored in specific database for each account. 

## Site Owners Goals

The site owners goals of this page are to provide a platform for users to store past events to keep track of.

# Colour Scheme <a name="color-scheme"></a>

The site uses a fairly plain colour scheme with elements of bright colour to draw the user to certain features such as buttons. The main body is a slight grey colour whereas the header and footer are a darker grey. Most of the buttons feature a bright pink colour with a green colour on hover. 

## Font Family

![image](readMeImgs/Screenshot 2023-05-15 at 21.32.01.png)

I have used a font from Google Fonts named Roboto.

# Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>

I have made wire frames for desktop and mobile. These can be seen below. I've hidden the hero image on the mobile view to make the layout less busy on smaller screens.
